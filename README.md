Description-

The idea of the project is to facilitate the delivery of food items from different locations i.e 19th hole , AnB and CnD from around campus to your doorstep.
This project is a desktop application designed primarily for use in food delivery in and around campus. Through these services restaurants can sell and distribute their resources at minimal resource usage effectively with high profits by gaining the customer trust.
There is no confinement for placing and receiving the orders, since the order can be placed online. There will be no waiting time with the vast amount of verities at the comfortable prices. To develop this application database is the main part which will communicate through the application to retrieve the details. We will be creating the food ordering database built on MySQL as a platform using netbeans as an IDE.


This project is a desktop application to help users access restaurants. This project is developed using JavaSwing for front-end and MySQL for back-end.
